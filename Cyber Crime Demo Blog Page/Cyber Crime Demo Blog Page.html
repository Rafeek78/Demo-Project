<h1>CYBER CRIME üïµüèª</h1>
<p>Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is that of curiosity. My crime is that of outsmarting you, something that you will never forgive me for. I am a hacker, and this is my manifesto. You may stop this individual, but you can‚Äôt stop us all‚Ä¶ after all, we‚Äôre all alike.</p>

      <strong>  Cybercrime is a type of crime involving a computer or a computer network.[1][2] The computer may have been used in committing the crime, or it may be the target.[3] Cybercrime may harm someone's security or finances.[4][5]

Internationally, both state and non-state actors engage in cybercrimes, including espionage, financial theft, and other cross-border crimes. Cybercrimes crossing international borders and involving the actions of at least one nation-state are sometimes referred to as cyberwarfare. Warren Buffett describes cybercrime as the "number one problem with mankind"[6] and said that it "poses real risks to humanity".[7]

A 2014 report sponsored by McAfee estimated that cybercrime had resulted in $445 billion USD in annual damage to the global economy.[8] Approximately $1.5 billion was lost in 2012 to online credit and debit card fraud in the US.[9] In 2018, a study by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), in partnership with McAfee, concluded that nearly 1 percent of global gross domestic product (GDP), close to $600 billion, is lost to cybercrime each year.[10] The World Economic Forum 2020 Global Risk Report confirmed that organized cybercrime groups are joining forces to commit criminal activities online, while estimating the likelihood of their detection and prosecution to be less than 1 percent in the US.[11] There are also many privacy concerns surrounding cybercrime when confidential information is intercepted or disclosed, legally or otherwise.</strong>

    <h1>DARK WEB</h1>
    <h2>Surface Web | Bergie Web | Deep Web</h2>
    <p>The best dark web sites provide access to educational materials, host secure services, or bypass government censorship. Dark websites are hidden under layers of encryption that cloak user activity, which can be a boon to whistleblowers, activists, and others who don‚Äôt want anyone tracking their activity.</p>

    <p>A hacker is a person who breaks into a computer system. The reasons for hacking can be many: installing malware, stealing or destroying data, disrupting service, and more. Hacking can also be done for ethical reasons, such as trying to find software vulnerabilities so they can be fixed.</p>
